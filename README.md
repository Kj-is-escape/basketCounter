# basketCounter

Simple online counter for basketball free throws.

This website was built for a specific usage and its features are very limited.

## Usage

This software is supposed to be used as part of a setup in wich a basketball hoop is connected to a mouse and scoring makes the mouse click. 
To start playing press the spacebar and a timer will start on the screen, when the timer runs off,  your score and the maximum score will be shown on screen.
To play again simply press the spacebar once again.

**Notes:**
* Refreshing the page resets the whole game, erasing the highest score.
* There's a minimum time between two consecutive points to allow for debouncing.
* The page is meant to be used in fullscreen on a screen in "lanscape mode" (w>h).
